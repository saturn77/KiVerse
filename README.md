# KiVerse
A *versatile* KiCad library enabled via programmatic generation of library components, along 
with various symbols, footprints, and 3D models for self managed local use. 

# Introduction 
KiVerse is a library with auto-generation capabilities in addition to standard symbols, footprints,
and 3d models. The autogeneration feature allows for rapid creation of local libraries relative
to KiCad, making your own library that is customized to spcific design goals and needs. 

# Background
KiVerse borrows from the atlantix-eda repository methodology, to construct a graphical user
interface for users to add programmatically components to their local library. This, in addittion
to the existing foundation components, make custom library development a well defined process.
